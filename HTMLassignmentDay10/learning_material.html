    <h1>Why to Learn java programming</h1>
    <p>Java is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that was designed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in 1991 . The compilation of the Java applications results in the bytecode that can be run on any platform using the Java Virtual Machine. Because of this, Java is also known as a WORA (Write Once, Run Anywhere) language. In modern times, Java is one of the most popular programming languages as it can be used to design customized applications that are light and fast and serve a variety of purposes. According to the TIOBE Index for April 2022, Java is among the top three programming languages.</p>

    <dt id="reasons">1. Java has Multiple Open Source Libraries</dt>
    <dd id="description01">Open-source libraries have resources that can be copied, studied, changed, shared, etc. There are multiple open source libraries in Java such as <em>JHipster, Maven, Google Guava, Apache Commons </em>, etc. that can be used to make Java development easier, cheaper and faster.    </dd>
    <dt id="reasons">2. Java has Powerful Development Tools</dt>
    <dd>There are many Integrated development environments (IDEs) in Java that provide various facilities for software development to programmers. Powerful Java IDEs such as Eclipse , NetBeans , IntelliJ IDEA , etc. play a big role in the success of Java. These IDEs provide many facilities such as debugging, syntax highlighting, code completion, language support, automated refactoring, etc. that make coding in Java easier and faster.</dd>
    <dt id="reasons">3. Java is Platform Independent</dt>
    <dd id="description02">Java is platform-independent as the Java source code is converted to byte code by the compiler which can then be executed on any platform using the Java Virtual Machine . Java is also known as a WORA (write once, run anywhere) language because it is platform-independent. Also, the development of most Java applications occurs in a Windows environment while they are run on a UNIX platform because of the platform-independent nature of Java. </dd>
